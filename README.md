## What db-transformer do?
-[ ] reading the configs from a **_config.toml_** file with predefined structure.
-[ ] creating a **postgres** database and connect to it.
-[ ] reading the data from a **json** file or from a **xml** file and transforming it to the postgres db.

## Goals from build this app.
- using the rust std lib.
- using the [serde.rs](https://serde.rs/) framework for **ser**ializing and **de**serializing Rust data structures.
- using the [diesel.rs](http://diesel.rs/) ORM and Query Builder to interact with the postgres database.
